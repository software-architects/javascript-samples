                        Angular does only update the bindings if we do something in response
                        to an async event.

                Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?
                You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! I call it luck. What
                good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle
                station ain't my idea of courage. It's more likeâ€¦suicide.
